ðŸ§ª Manual Testing Project â€“ OpenCart Demo E-Commerce Website

This project is based on manual testing of the OpenCart demo e-commerce website (https://demo.opencart.com/). The goal was to test the main features of the site and find functional issues through structured manual testing.

I created detailed test cases covering key areas such as:

Product search and filtering

Add to cart and checkout process

User registration and login

Order management and payment flow

Each test case was executed manually, and every issue found was reported as a bug with proper details, including steps to reproduce, expected vs actual results, and severity levels.

This project helped me understand the full testing life cycle â€” from test case design to execution and defect reporting. It also improved my skills in documentation, analysis, and identifying real-world issues in an e-commerce platform.

Overall, this project highlights my ability to perform end-to-end manual testing effectively and maintain clear, organized reports for better quality assurance.
